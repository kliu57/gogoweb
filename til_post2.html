<p>TIL Post 2</p>

<p>Today I learned how to review some else's Open Source project and file issues!</p>

<p>First, I cloned their project on my local machine.</p>

<p>Next, I followed their instructions on how to run the program.</p>

<p>Once I was familiar with how to run the program, I tried to run some edge cases to find bugs.</p>

<p>When I found a bug, I went to the Issues tab of their GitHub project and clicked New issue.</p>

<p>I gave the issue a title and short description as well as a screenshot and submitted the issue.</p>
