<p>TIL Post 1</p>

<p>Today I learned how to work with GitHub and VS Code to push changes!</p>

<p>First, I cloned my project to my local machine:</p>
<p>git clone <url></p>

<p>Next, I checked that I have the most recent changes:</p>
<p>git pull origin</p>

<p>I worked on my project locally and make changes to the project</p>

<p>When I was ready to push changes, I check which files have been changed:</p>
<p>git status</p>

<p>I added the files with changes:</p>
<p>git add <filename></p>

<p>I made a commit and write a message:</p>
<p>git commit -m <what I have changed></p>

<p>I pushed my changes to GitHub:</p>
<p>git push origin</p>
